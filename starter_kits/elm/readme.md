# Elm

Great choice!

I recommend using IntelliJ with the [elm plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10268-elm)

## Prerequisites
- npm (or whatever lets you install node dependencies from `package.json`)

## Getting started
- npm install (installs all dependencies, including elm)
- npm run setup (installs all elm dependencies)
- npm run dev (starts the elm reactor)
